# Mahjong Game Back-end and Related Testing Code
Hi, this project focuses on demonstrating the backend infrastructure of the mahjong game and building a comprehensive testing framework.
The back end is written in Java for integration with various front-end clients. 

In the future, we plan to provide local installation scripts (e.g., exe file) for seamless installation on different operating systems. This approach guarantees stability and ease of use, providing a smooth gaming experience for cross-platform users.


## Assistant Installation and Run
Requires IDEA development tool, project JDK >= 22
```console
