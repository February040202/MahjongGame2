# Mahjong Game 2

In a Java Mahjong game, traditional Mahjong rules are typically simulated, and players can interact with the game using a mouse. The game usually includes classic Mahjong gameplay elements such as drawing tiles, forming sets (like Pongs and Kongs), declaring Mahjong, and players need to arrange the tiles in their hands into valid combinations to achieve victory.
